 * Below is a sample of how to use this class to generate a log file.
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>Initiate the job my calling the factoty method <code>PurgeUtilityLogger.createNewInstance(OutputStream,
 * purgePath)</code> to instantiate the log and supply it with an output stream to hold the log and the root folder of
 * the purge.</li>
 * <li>Call setCurrentFilePath() each time you start processing a new import file. The log shows the file being imported
 * so it must be registered.</li>
 * <li>Call endJob() when the import is done to log the finish and release resources. If the the import terminates
 * abnormally this call should be in the finally block.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * To get a logger from any method use PurgeUtilitylogger.getLogger() which will return the IPurgeUtilityLog defined
 * above, or create a new phsuedo instance, if the code that's running is not part of the purgeUtility run.
