/**
 * JobEntryInterface is the main Java interface that a plugin implements. The responsibilities of the implementing class
 * are listed below:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Maintain job entry settings</b><br/>
 * The implementing class typically keeps track of job entry settings using private fields with corresponding getters
 * and setters. The dialog class implementing JobEntryDialogInterface is using the getters and setters to copy the user
 * supplied configuration in and out of the dialog.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * The following interface method also falls into the area of maintaining settings:<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <a href="#clone()"><code>public Object clone()</code></a> <br/>
 * This method is called when a job entry is duplicated in Spoon. It needs to return a deep copy of this job entry
 * object. It is essential that the implementing class creates proper deep copies if the job entry configuration is
 * stored in modifiable objects, such as lists or custom helper objects. This interface does not extend Cloneable, but
 * the implementing class will provide a similar method due to this interface.</li><br/>
 * <li><b>Serialize job entry settings</b><br>
 * The plugin needs to be able to serialize its settings to both XML and a PDI repository. The interface methods are as
 * follows:<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <a href="#getXML()"><code>public String getXML()</code></a><br/>
 * This method is called by PDI whenever a job entry needs to serialize its settings to XML. It is called when saving a
 * job in Spoon. The method returns an XML string, containing the serialized settings. The string contains a series of
 * XML tags, typically one tag per setting. The helper class org.pentaho.di.core.xml.XMLHandler is typically used to
 * construct the XML string.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <a href="#loadXML(org.w3c.dom.Node, java.util.List, java.util.List, org.pentaho.di.repository.Repository)">
 * <code>public void loadXML(...)</code></a></br> This method is called by PDI whenever a job entry needs to read its
 * settings from XML. The XML node containing the job entry's settings is passed in as an argument. Again, the helper
 * class org.pentaho.di.core.xml.XMLHandler is typically used to conveniently read the settings from the XML node.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <a href="#saveRep(org.pentaho.di.repository.Repository, org.pentaho.di.repository.ObjectId)">
 * <code>public void saveRep(...)</code></a><br/>
 * This method is called by PDI whenever a job entry needs to save its settings to a PDI repository. The repository
 * object passed in as the first argument provides a convenient set of methods for serializing job entry settings. When
 * calling repository serialization methods, job id and job entry id are required. The job id is passed in to saveRep()
 * as an argument, and the job entry id can be obtained by a call to getObjectId() inherited from the base class.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <a href=
 * "#loadRep(org.pentaho.di.repository.Repository, org.pentaho.di.repository.ObjectId, java.util.List,
 * java.util.List)">
 * <code>public void loadRep(...)</code></a><br/>
 * This method is called by PDI whenever a job entry needs to read its configuration from a PDI repository. The job
 * entry id given in the arguments should be used as the identifier when using the repository's serialization methods.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <quote>Hint: When developing plugins, make sure the serialization code is in synch with the settings available from
 * the job entry dialog. When testing a plugin in Spoon, PDI will internally first save and load a copy of the
 * job.</quote></li><br/>
 * <li><b>Provide access to dialog class</b><br/>
 * PDI needs to know which class will take care of the settings dialog for the job entry. The interface method
 * getDialogClassName() must return the name of the class implementing the JobEntryDialogInterface.</li></br>
 * <li><b>Provide information about possible outcomes</b><br/>
 * A job entry may support up to three types of outgoing hops: true, false, and unconditional. Sometimes it does not
 * make sense to support all three possibilities. For instance, if the job entry performs a task that does not produce a
 * boolean outcome, like the dummy job entry, it may make sense to suppress the true and false outgoing hops. There are
 * other job entries, which carry an inherent boolean outcome, like the "file exists" job entry for instance. It may
 * make sense in such cases to suppress the unconditional outgoing hop.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * The job entry plugin class must implement two methods to indicate to PDI which outgoing hops it supports:<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <a href="#evaluates()"><code>public boolean evaluates()</code></a><br/>
 * This method must return true if the job entry supports the true/false outgoing hops. If the job entry does not
 * support distinct outcomes, it must return false.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <a href="#isUnconditional()"><code>public boolean isUnconditional()</code></a><br/>
 * This method must return true if the job entry supports the unconditional outgoing hop. If the job entry does not
 * support the unconditional hop, it must return false.</li><br/>
 * <li><b>Execute a job entry task</b><br/>
 * The class implementing JobEntryInterface executes the actual job entry task by implementing the following method:
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * <a href="#execute(org.pentaho.di.core.Result, int)"><code>public Result execute(..)</code></a><br/>
 * The execute() method is going to be called by PDI when it is time for the job entry to execute its logic. The
 * arguments are a result object, which is passed in from the previously executed job entry and an integer number
 * indicating the distance of the job entry from the start entry of the job.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * The job entry should execute its configured task, and report back on the outcome. A job entry does that by calling
 * certain methods on the passed in <a href="../../core/Result.html">Result</a> object:<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <code>prev_result.setNrErrors(..)</code><br/>
 * The job entry needs to indicate whether it has encountered any errors during execution. If there are errors,
 * setNrErrors must be called with the number of errors encountered (typically this is 1). If there are no errors,
 * setNrErrors must be called with an argument of 0.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <code>prev_result.setResult(..)</code><br/>
 * The job entry must indicate the outcome of the task. This value determines which output hops can be followed next. If
 * a job entry does not support evaluation, it need not call prev_result.setResult().<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Finally, the passed in prev_result object must be returned.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
