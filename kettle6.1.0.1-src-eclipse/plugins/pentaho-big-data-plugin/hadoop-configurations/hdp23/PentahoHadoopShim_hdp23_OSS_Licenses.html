intended for use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance
of any nuclear facility and Sun and its licensors disclaim any express
or implied warranty of fitness for such uses.

interest in or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name of
Sun or its licensors is granted under this Agreement.
</OL><P>
<LI>      Term and Termination.

The license and service term are set forth in your
Entitlement(s). Your rights under this Agreement will terminate
immediately without notice from Sun if you materially breach it or
take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its licensors' rights to
Software. Sun may terminate this Agreement should any Software become,
or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become, the subject of a
claim of intellectual property infringement or trade secret
misappropriation. Upon termination, you will cease use of, and
destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun. Sections
1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive termination of the Agreement.

<LI>      Java Compatibility and Open Source.

classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under
compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source
developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions
and open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many
of its products.
<P>
Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and
open source licenses from such communities and third parties that
govern the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder
do not alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open
source licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of
liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in
this distribution.

<LI>      Limited Warranty.
<P>
Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of
purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which
Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials
and workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software
is provided "AS IS". Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability
under this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace
Software media or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do not
allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so the above may not
apply to you. This limited warranty gives you specific legal
rights. You may have others, which vary from state to state.

<LI>      Disclaimer of Warranty.
<P>
UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD
TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.

<LI>     Limitation of Liability.
<P>
TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will
Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including
negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software
under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the
above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states do
not allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so
some of the terms above may not be applicable to you.

<LI>     Export Regulations.
<P>
All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials
delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S.  export control
laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other
countries.  You agree to comply strictly with these laws and
regulations and acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain
any licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required after
delivery to you.

<LI>     U.S. Government Restricted Rights.
<P>
If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government
or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any
tier), then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying
documentation will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in
accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of
Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for
non-DOD acquisitions).

<LI>     Governing Law.
<P>

law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any
jurisdiction will apply.

<LI>     Severability.

Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless
omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this
Agreement will immediately terminate.

<LI>     Integration.
<P>
This Agreement, including any terms contained in your Entitlement, is
the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject
matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written
communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails
over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order,
acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to
its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.  No modification
of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an
authorized representative of each party.

        offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
        recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the
        Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
        Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
        result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
    </blockquote>

        under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
        that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does
        not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in
        this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must
        make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
        Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
        for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
        offer.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3.6. Larger Works.</blockquote>

        of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
        requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
    </blockquote>
    <p>4. Versions of the License.</p>
    <blockquote>4.1. New Versions.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
        from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
        4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>4.2. Effect of New Versions.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
        the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the
        Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
        otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the
        Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received
        the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
        Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license
        steward.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>4.3. Modified Versions.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software,
        You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any
        references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License);
        and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.
    </blockquote>
    <p>5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>

            DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
            ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
            OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS

        comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.

        survive.

    <blockquote>6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
        Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim
        is referred to as &ldquo;Participant&rdquo;) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor
        Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial
        Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
        indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the
        Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
        from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,
        unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against
        such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

    </blockquote>
    <p>9. MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
            License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
            make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
            contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
            otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
            License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue
            specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for
            costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
            application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
            expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
            construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible
            for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and
            regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered
            Software.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages
            arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
            work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.
            Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.</p>

<li> MISCELLANEOUS.</li>
    <p>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be

relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a

distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission

computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.
252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.

<li> MISCELLANEOUS.</li>
    <p>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be

jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court
costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
United States export administration regulations (and the export
control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
    </p>
<li> RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</li>

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
of liability.

<dd>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>

<dd>59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA<br>

<dd>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>

<dd>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br><br>

<dd>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts<br>

<dd>as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br>

<dd>the version number 2.1.]<br><br>
<br>

</dl><h2>Preamble</h2>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. <br><br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. <br><br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.<br><br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. <br><br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. <br><br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. <br><br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. <br><br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. <br><br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. <br><br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. <br><br>
We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. <br><br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. <br><br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. <br><br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. <br><br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. <br><br>
<h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h2><b>0.</b> This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br><br>
A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. <br><br>
The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) <br><br>
&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br><br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. <br><br>
<b>1.</b> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. <br><br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. <br><br>
<b>2.</b> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: <br><br>
<dl>
<dd>a) The modified work must itself be a software library. <br><br>

<dd>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br>

<dd>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. <br><br>

<dd>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. <br><br>

<dd>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) <br><br>

<dd>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. <br><br>

<dd>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. <br><br>

<dd>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. <br><br>

</dl>3.</b> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. <br><br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. <br><br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. <br><br>
4.</b> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. <br><br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>
5.</b> A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. <br><br>
However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. <br><br>
When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. <br><br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) <br><br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. <br><br>
6.</b> As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. <br><br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: <br><br>

<dl>
<dd>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) <br><br>

<dd>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. <br><br>

<dd>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. <br><br>

<dd>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. <br><br>

<dd>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br><br>

</dl>For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. <br><br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. <br><br>
7.</b> You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: <br><br>

<dl>
<dd>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. <br><br>

<dd>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br><br>

</dl>8.</b> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. <br><br>
9.</b> You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. <br><br>
10.</b> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. <br><br>
11.</b> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. <br><br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. <br><br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. <br><br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. <br><br>
12.</b> If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. <br><br>
13.</b> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. <br><br>
14.</b> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. <br><br>
NO WARRANTY <br><br>
15. </b>BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. <br><br>
16.</b> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br><br>
<h2>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>
<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</h2>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). <br><br>
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <br><br>

<dl>
<dd>one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.<br>

<dd>Copyright (C) year name of author <br><br>

<dd>This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>

<dd>modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>

<dd>License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>

<dd>version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br><br>

<dd>This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>

<dd>but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>

<dd>MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU<br>

<dd>Lesser General Public License for more details.<br><br>

<dd>You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>

<dd>License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br>

<dd>Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA<br><br>

</dl>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. <br><br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: <br><br>

<dl>
<dd>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in<br>

        this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
        Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software
        in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable
        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3.2. Modifications.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this
        License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
        sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3.3. Required Notices.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of
        the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within
        the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
        Contributor or the Initial Developer.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3.4. Application of Additional Terms.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or
        restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
        offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
        recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the
        Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
        Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
        result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or
        under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
        that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does
        not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in
        this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must
        make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
        Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
        for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
        offer.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3.6. Larger Works.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms
        of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
        requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
    </blockquote>
    <p>4. Versions of the License.</p>
    <blockquote>4.1. New Versions.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
        from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
        4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>4.2. Effect of New Versions.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
        the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the
        Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
        otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the
        Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received
        the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
        Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license
        steward.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>4.3. Modified Versions.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software,
        You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any
        references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License);
        and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.
    </blockquote>
    <p>5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
            KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
            IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
            THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
            DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
            ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
            OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
            DISCLAIMER.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>6. TERMINATION.</p>
    <blockquote>6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to
        comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
        Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
        survive.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
        Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim
        is referred to as &ldquo;Participant&rdquo;) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor
        Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial
        Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
        indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the
        Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
        from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period,
        unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against
        such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant
        Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
        settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the
        licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining
        the amount or value of any payment or license.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have
        been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to
        You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
    </blockquote>
    <p>7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR
            OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
            SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
            INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
            GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
            LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION
            OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
            NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
            EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
            APPLY TO YOU.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The Covered Software is a &ldquo;commercial item,&rdquo; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct.
            1995), consisting of &ldquo;commercial computer software&rdquo; (as that term is defined at 48
            C.F.R. &sect; 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &ldquo;commercial computer software documentation&rdquo; as such
            terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
            227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with
            only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
            any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
            under this License.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>9. MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
            License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
            make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
            contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
            otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
            License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue
            specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for
            costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
            application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
            expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
            construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible
            for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and
            regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered
            Software.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages
            arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
            work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.
            Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.</p>
    </blockquote>

This U.S.  Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other  FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government  rights in computer software under this License.</p>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<p>10.  RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>

control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
of liability.
